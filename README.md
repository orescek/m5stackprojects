Simple projects using m5stack devices 

Due that I am lazy teaching my kids math I started to create simple math problems. For now all  are in separated files but I am planing to create full app.
All is done through UiFlow v2.0 and I am using Core2 device - probably others will work. 

Inspired from: https://github.com/VolosR/M5CoreMath

# Setup environment 
Jump to https://m5stack.com/uiflow and download or use web browser. I will write maybe detailed instructions(but I am lazy so dunno when).

# Programs

## Math

### addition.m5f2

Calculate two numbers (from 0-100) by choosing from 3 answers. It will give you random quote for busting morale( ok wife said they need to first do math and then reading - so I combined it :smile: )
